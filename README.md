# ML-Based Stock Trading System

This project explores a machine learning driven trading system that uses classification and transformer models and 
technical indicators to generate BUY/HOLD/SELL signals for stock trading. Results suggest that ML-based models capture 
market patterns much more effectively than traditional MACD-based approaches.


## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This system combines:
- **ML Models**: Random Forest, XGBoost, Transformer-based neural networks with attention mechanisms
- **Technical Indicators**: MACD, RSI, moving averages, etc.
- **Multiple Strategies**: Pure ML, traditional MACD, and hybrid approaches
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Integration tests and performance evaluation
- **Visualization Tools**: Strategy debugging and performance analysis

The system processes **daily stock candlestick data**, engineers features from historical data, trains ML models, 
and generates **next-day trading signals** (BUY/HOLD/SELL) with detailed performance tracking.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- **Daily Trading Signals**: Generates next-day BUY/HOLD/SELL predictions
- **Transformer Model**: Attention-based neural network for sequence prediction
- **Feature Engineering**: 25+ technical indicators and price-based features
- **Multi-Strategy Trading**: MACD, ML-based, and combined approaches
- **Risk Management**: Sharpe ratio optimization and portfolio tracking
- **Performance Visualization**: In-depth charts for examining stock-level trading decisions and portfolio evolution
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full integration test suite
