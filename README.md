# ML-Based Stock Trading System

This project explores a machine learning driven trading system that uses classification and transformer models and 
technical indicators to generate BUY/HOLD/SELL signals for stock trading. Results suggest that ML-based models capture 
market patterns much more effectively than traditional MACD-based approaches.

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This system combines:
- **ML Models**: Random Forest, XGBoost, Transformer-based neural networks with attention mechanisms
- **Technical Indicators**: MACD, RSI, moving averages, etc.
- **Multiple Strategies**: Pure ML, traditional MACD, and hybrid approaches
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Integration tests and performance evaluation
- **Visualization Tools**: Strategy debugging and performance analysis

The system processes **daily stock candlestick data**, engineers features from historical data, trains ML models, 
and generates **next-day trading signals** (BUY/HOLD/SELL) with detailed performance tracking.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- **Daily Trading Signals**: Generates next-day BUY/HOLD/SELL predictions
- **Transformer Model**: Attention-based neural network for sequence prediction
- **Feature Engineering**: 25+ technical indicators and price-based features
- **Multi-Strategy Trading**: MACD, ML-based, and combined approaches
- **Risk Management**: Sharpe ratio optimization and portfolio tracking
- **Performance Visualization**: In-depth charts for examining stock-level trading decisions and portfolio evolution
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full integration test suite

## ðŸ§ª Testing the System

### Quick Start Test
The repository includes a comprehensive integration test with sample data (100 stocks through April 2025) to validate the entire ML trading pipeline:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run test (from project root)
python test/test_int.py
```

### What Gets Tested
- Complete ML trading pipeline from data loading to performance evaluation
- Feature engineering with technical indicators (MACD, RSI, moving averages)
- Model training (Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers)
- Three trading strategies: MACD, ML, and Combined
- Performance metrics including Sharpe ratios and portfolio values

### Test Output
Results are saved to `test/test_results/` including:
- Performance report with detailed metrics
- Trading signal visualization charts
